Objective: Simulate customer arrivals and service in a bank to analyze and optimize customer wait times and service efficiency.
Real-World Scenario: Model a bank with multiple tellers (service counters), each serving customers. Customers arrive randomly, and each customer requires a random amount of time to complete their service.
Metrics to Calculate:
Average Wait Time: The average time customers spend waiting to be served.
Queue Length: The number of customers waiting at any given time.
Resource Utilization: The proportion of time tellers are actively serving customers.
